Reference [23] proved that we can compute the same blur filter f in both cases.

R[2]gives so a brilliant abstraction of the most popular methods deconvolution and artifact minimization in the software industry.

R[5] this textbook provides early and basic approaches usually assume a priori knowledge to estimate the blur filter in deblurring the input image.

R[4]propose  a variational Bayesian approach using an assumption on the statistical property of the image gradient distribution to approximate the unblurred image.

R[25] propose a lot of algorithm for deblurring image

R[3.22,14]propose natural image matting techniques.

In, R[17] , out of focus blur is considered in video matting  using multiple cameras.

R[11,12] proposed model a blurred image as an autoregressive moving average(ARMA) process.

In R[10,19], recursive inverse filtering methods(RIF) are proposed to iteratively solve the image restoration problem
 
Image Matting – (transparency) 
Matting refers to the problem of accurate foreground estimation in images and video
